## Student Discounts (Bus, From Home To Putrajaya Sentral)

* **RapidKL / MRT Feeder Buses** (like T505) **accept the MyRapid Concession Card**.

* Works across **RapidKL buses, MRT, LRT, Monorail**.
* **Not valid on ERL (KLIA Transit/Express)** — ERL has its own student concession (MyKad).

 **So for daily travel Cyberjaya ↔ Putrajaya Sentral, you and your sis will pay ~RM1.50–1.70 per trip** instead of RM3.00–3.40.
