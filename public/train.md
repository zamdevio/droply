# 🏠 Housing Choice: Furnished vs Unfurnished

If we take a **furnished unit**, we’ll be paying higher rent every month just for furniture.
Example: **+RM600/month** → that’s **RM21,600 gone in 3 years**. And when we move out, we own nothing.

If we rent **unfurnished**, we spend around **RM10k upfront** to buy our own stuff, use it comfortably, and later **resell 60–70%**. That way, we save money long-term and still keep value instead of burning cash.

**Slangy Reality Check:**

1. RM21k in 3 years for someone else’s sofa? **Nah fam.**
2. Furnished = **landlord’s furniture tax 💀**
3. Extra RM600/month → **RM21k**, better to buy + sell later.
4. Paying for furniture you don’t keep = **zero gain.**
5. Bro, RM21k boleh jadi **kereta second hand** already.
6. RM21k down the drain vs **buy-and-resell = no contest.**
